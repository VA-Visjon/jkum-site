Not used in other countries.\n</code></pre> <pre><code>Pros:\n\n- Very simple to implement\n- Easy to read and understand\n\nCons:\n\n- Relies on old SOSI codes, which has been deprecated for a long time.\n- Not manhole-oriented. Relies on the need to know where the other end of\n  the pipe is situated. Cannot represent a manhole by itself.\n- Can not represent a manhole as a single object. In order to cover all aspects\n  of a manhole, it needs to create lots of different objects that may or may not\n  be related\n</code></pre> <pre><code>Pros:\n\n- Well established file standard that's in use within the construction domain.\n- Integrates well into AEC-tools (Architechture, Engineering and Construction)\n\nCons:\n\n- Complex file standard with lots and lots of different supported objects.\n  It is also more building-oriented, and does not fully support details \n  for manhole objects.\n- File contents can have lot of freedom when it comes to properties and\n  property sets. There is a huge risk that different vendors will apply\n  different names for properties, thus making information transport difficult.\n</code></pre> <p>Overall, we're led to the conclusion that no file format exists that can truly cover all we want to know about a single manhole, without relying on lots of other objects (the pipes) or doing geometric calculations to identify angles for inlets or outlets.</p> <ol> <li> <p>There are several file formats, but none that covers all the requirements we've identified in our works with this standard.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>There are no standard.
