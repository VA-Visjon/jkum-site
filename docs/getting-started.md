# Getting started

The project roadmap describes a goal of establishing open-source parsers for the
JKUM-file format for lots of different programming languages. Currently, only a few
are established.

| Language | Supported? | Status | Repo |

| C# | :material-check-circle:{ .success } Yes | Completed | [:material-github: JkumParser](https://github.com/hansmei/JkumParser) |
| python | :material-close-circle:{ .error } No |  |  |

If you are familiar with any of the non-supported languages and want to contribute,
feel free to drop an email to `kontakt@vavisjon.no` about it or submit a pull request, and
we will add it here.
